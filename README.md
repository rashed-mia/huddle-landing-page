### What I learned
---

I have learned how to use CSS Grid to position the content and create a responsive layout. I have also learned how to use CSS Flex to create a responsive layout. I have also learned how to use JavaScript to dynamically populate the content from the local JSON data. I have also learned how to use CSS transitions to create smooth animations on hover and focus states.

 see some snippet below:

``` 
Tailwind css

  <div
        class="container mx-auto flex max-sm:flex-col justify-between max-sm:space-y-12 py-12 px-2"
      >
        <div
          class="flex flex-col justify-center items-center sm:items-start max-sm:w-[70%] max-sm:mx-auto max-sm:text-center lg:space-y-6 sm:pr-3"
        >
          <h1
            class="xl:w-[80%] font-poppines font-bold xl:font-extrabold text-3xl sm:text-2xl xl:text-4xl"
          >
            Build The Community Your Fans Will Love
          </h1>
          <p class="xl:w-[80%] font-normal max-sm:py-5 sm:py-2">
            Huddle re-imagines the way we build communities. You have a voice,
            but so does your audience. Create connections with your users as you
            engage in genuine discussion.
          </p>
          <button
            class="xl:w-[80%] max-sm:w-[90%] bg-primary px-4 py-2 rounded-full text-white active:bg-primaryActive"
          >

          </button>
        </div>
        <div class="">
          <img
            class="object-contain"
            src="/images/illustration-mockups.svg"
            alt="mockups"
          />
        </div>
      </div>
